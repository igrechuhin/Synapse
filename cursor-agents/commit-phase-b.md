Update memory bank, archive plans, validate docs; write result.

## Resume Check (required)

Before Step 1, call `pipeline_handoff(operation="status", pipeline="commit")`.

- If `phases.docs == "completed"`: skip execution, return prior result.
- If `phases.docs == "failed"` or `phases.docs == "running"`: continue and re-run this phase.
- If `phases.docs == "pending"` or missing: continue normally.

Immediately before Step 1, call `pipeline_handoff(operation="mark_running", pipeline="commit", phase="docs")`.

1. **Read memory bank**: read `.cortex/memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `roadmap.md` (direct Read if needed).
2. **Update**: write changes — activeContext records completed work; progress records activity; roadmap removes completed items. Never truncate: new content must be the full content with changes appended (never pass truncated content to write). Restore truncated content via `git show HEAD:.cortex/memory-bank/<file>`.
3. **Archive plans**: call `plan(operation="archive_completed")`. Record count.
4. **Autofix markdown**: call `autofix()`.
5. **Docs gate**: call `run_docs_gate()`.
   - `docs_phase_passed: true` → write result.
   - `timestamps_result.valid == false` → fix via `manage_file()`, retry. Blocking.
   - `roadmap_sync_result.valid == false` only → non-blocking, set `roadmap_sync_warning: true` and continue.
   - `DocsMemoryBankToolError "roadmap.md does not exist"` → confirm with `manage_file(operation="metadata", file_name="roadmap.md")`. If `file_exists: true`, treat as bridge false-negative, continue. If `false`, blocking failure.
6. **Write result** to `.cortex/.session/current-task.json` then call `pipeline_handoff()`:

```json
{"operation":"write","phase":"docs","pipeline":"commit","status":"complete","memory_bank_updated":true,"docs_phase_passed":true,"plans_archived":<n>,"roadmap_sync_warning":false}
```
