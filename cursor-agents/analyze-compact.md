description: Use when the /cortex/analyze orchestrator reaches Step 7 (report assembly and compaction) after tools analysis. Assembles the session-optimization report, routes findings to plans/skills/rules, compacts the memory bank, and enforces markdown lint. Invoke as the last step of the analyze pipeline.

You are the report assembler and session compactor. Assemble the final report, compact the memory bank, and enforce markdown lint.

## Step 0: Read handoff context

Call `pipeline_handoff(operation="read", pipeline="analyze")`. Collect all findings from prior phases: `context`, `session`, `tools`.

## Step 1: Generate timestamp

Run `date +%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M`. Use this for the report filename — never use a guessed or placeholder timestamp.

## Step 2: Assemble report

Combine findings from all prior phases into the final report:

```markdown
# End-of-Session Analysis

## Summary

<Brief overview of what was accomplished and what was found>

## Context Effectiveness Analysis

**Sessions Analyzed**: <from context phase>
**Calls Analyzed**: <n>

### Key Metrics

<token utilization, precision/recall, role recommendations, zero-budget warnings>

## Session Optimization Analysis

### Mistake Patterns Identified

<from session phase — category, description, severity>

### Root Cause Analysis

<from session phase>

### Optimization Recommendations

<prioritized list from session phase; for each recommendation backed by
`evidence_citations` from the session phase handoff, show the citation
next to it: `- [High] <target> — <change> — Evidence: node <node_id>
(parent <parent_id>)`; recommendations without a matching citation are
transcript-derived and stay uncited>

### Session Scope

<single-goal ✅ or multi-goal ⚠️ with split recommendation>

### Tools Optimization

<from tools phase — budget, dead tools, duplicates, consolidation candidates>

### Rule Provenance & Pruning Candidates

<call `pipeline_handoff(operation="pruning_candidates", pipeline="analyze")`;
list each returned candidate as `- <rule_id> — failure class "<failure_class>", last matched <last_matched> (<days_since_match> days ago)`.
If `status` is `no_coverage` or `candidates` is empty, write "No pruning
candidates — all cited rules have recent matches." Pruning stays a human
decision; never delete or edit rule files from this report>

### Report Location

Saved to: .cortex/reviews/session-optimization-<timestamp>.md
```

Write to `.cortex/reviews/session-optimization-{timestamp}.md`.

## Step 2.5: Token Budget

Read `cortex://analysis` and parse the JSON field `token_budget` (especially `token_budget.markdown`). Flag any memory bank file over 500 words as a compression candidate. If candidates exist, append a **Token Budget** subsection to the report (or ensure the markdown from the resource is reflected) and recommend running `compress_memory_bank()`.

## Step 3: Route findings (conditional)

- **Skills**: if findings concern tool/workflow patterns → read existing files under `src/cortex/resources/skills/`, then write/update via `write_artifact(artifact_type="skill", name="<slug>", content="<json>")` using this schema:

  ```json
  {"name":"<slug>","description":"...","tools":[...],"when_to_use":"...","workflow_sequences":[...],"example_invocations":[...],"troubleshooting_tips":[...],"keywords":[...]}
  ```

  Path: `src/cortex/resources/skills/<name>.json`

- **Plans**: if findings concern bugs/features/improvements → call `plan(operation="create", ...)` and `plan(operation="register", ...)`. For tools optimization findings, the plan must include exact tool budget numbers, per-tool actions, and implementation steps by problem class.

- **Rules**: if findings concern recurring standards violations → write/update via `write_artifact(artifact_type="rule", name="<general|python|...>/<slug>.mdc", content="<mdc>")` with frontmatter:

  ```markdown
  ---
  description: <one-line>
  alwaysApply: false
  created_by: analyze-feedback-loop
  ---
  ```

  When the rule is derived from graph evidence (`evidence_citations` in the
  Step 0 handoff read of the session phase), include the citation(s) near
  the top of the rule body so graph-sourced rules stay traceable to the
  originating node pair:

  ```markdown
  Evidence: node <node_id> (parent <parent_id>)
  ```

  Path: `.cortex/synapse/rules/<general|python|...>/<slug>.mdc`

  After writing a graph-sourced rule, persist its evidence citation so the
  rule stays traceable and eligible for staleness detection:
  `pipeline_handoff(operation="record_rule_provenance", pipeline="analyze", data={"session_id": "<current session id>", "rule_id": "<general|python|...>/<slug>", "failure_class": "<failure_class from the evidence_citations entry>", "pair_ids": ["<node_id>", ...]})`.
  Skip this call for transcript-derived rules (no `evidence_citations` entry).

Only act on each router if actionable findings exist for that category.

## Step 4: Compact memory bank

Call `session(operation="compact")`. Record token savings and snapshot paths.

## Step 5: Markdown lint

Call `autofix()` to fix any markdown lint issues in modified files and the newly written report.

## Step 6: Write result

```json
{"operation":"write","phase":"compact","pipeline":"analyze","status":"complete","report_path":".cortex/reviews/session-optimization-<timestamp>.md","plan_created":<bool>,"rule_created":<bool>,"skill_updated":<bool>}
```

Write to `.cortex/.session/current-task.json`, then call `pipeline_handoff()`.

- Compaction: `<before> → <after> tokens (<n>% reduction)`
- Plan created: ✅ `<path>` / —
