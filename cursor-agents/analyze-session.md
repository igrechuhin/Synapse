You are the session optimization analysis specialist. Identify mistake patterns and generate recommendations.

## Step 0: Read handoff context

Call `pipeline_handoff(operation="read", pipeline="analyze", phase="session")`. Load session summary and context effectiveness findings from prior phase.

## Step 1: Gather session signals

**Graph evidence first (primary, higher-confidence)**: call
`pipeline_handoff(operation="preference_pairs", pipeline="analyze", data={"session_id": "<current session id>"})`
and `pipeline_handoff(operation="repeated_failures", pipeline="analyze", data={"session_id": "<current session id>"})`
as the FIRST evidence source. Each returns sibling-node pairs/clusters
(same parent, divergent `COMPLETED`/`FAILED` status) from the experience
store — a graph pattern match, not a transcript scrape.

- If the response has `"status": "no_coverage"` or `"coverage": false`, the
  store has no data for this session — fall back to the transcript-scraping
  primary signals below, and mark any resulting findings
  `confidence_source: transcript` (lower-confidence).
- If `"coverage": true`, use the returned `pairs`/`clusters` as primary,
  higher-confidence evidence for mistake patterns in Step 2 — each pair's
  `failed_node.id` and `parent_id` become the evidence citation carried
  through Steps 3–4 (`confidence_source: graph`). Also call
  `pipeline_handoff(operation="refresh_rule_matches", pipeline="analyze", data={"session_id": "<current session id>"})`
  so any existing rule citing one of this session's recurring failure
  classes gets its `last_matched` bumped (keeps the pruning-candidate
  report in analyze-compact accurate).

**Primary signals** (always available; used when graph coverage is
false or absent, or to corroborate graph findings):

- Memory bank files: read `manage_file(file_name="activeContext.md", operation="read")`, `manage_file(file_name="progress.md", operation="read")`. If args stripped, read `.cortex/memory-bank/` directly.
- Recent commits: `git log --oneline -5 --name-only`
- Git diff: `git diff --stat HEAD`

**Optional signals**:

- `analyze(target="context")` — may return `no_data` for workflow-only sessions; use primary signals as fallback.
- Tool anomalies: `query_usage(query_type="anomalies", hours=24)` — if unavailable, omit subsection.

## Step 2: Identify patterns and root causes

Categorize findings:

1. **Mistake patterns**: type/system violations, code organization, rule compliance, process violations, tool usage, documentation errors
2. **Root causes**: missing guidance in prompts/rules, incomplete validation, process gaps, tool limitations
3. **Memory bank write discipline**: flag any memory bank edits that used `Write`/`StrReplace` instead of `manage_file()` — all memory-bank edits must use `manage_file`

**Session scope risk**: detect multi-goal sessions (infrastructure/tooling mixed with feature implementation). If detected:

- Note "Session Scope Risk: multi-goal session"
- Give one concrete split recommendation
- One sentence on why combined scope increased failure risk

## Step 3: Generate recommendations

Prioritized recommendations for Synapse prompts/rules:

- Prompt improvements: target file/section, expected impact
- Rule improvements: target file/section, expected impact
- Process improvements: workflow changes, expected impact

**Evidence citation (required for graph-sourced recommendations)**: any
recommendation derived from `preference_pairs`/`repeated_failures` graph
evidence (Step 1) must include an
`Evidence: node <failed_node.id> (parent <parent_id>)` citation in its
recommendation line. Transcript-derived recommendations stay uncited or are
marked `(transcript, lower-confidence)`.

**Failure class**: for each graph-sourced recommendation, note the
originating failure class (the cited `failed_node.label`, or the
`repeated_failures` cluster `label`) alongside the citation — the
report-assembly phase needs it to record rule provenance if the
recommendation is accepted as a Synapse rule.

## Step 4: Write result

Include an `evidence_citations` array (one
`{"node_id":..., "parent_id":..., "failure_class":...}` entry per
graph-sourced recommendation from Step 3) so citations survive the handoff
to the compact/report-assembly phase:

```json
{"operation":"write","phase":"session","pipeline":"analyze","status":"complete","patterns_found":<n>,"recommendations":<n>,"evidence_citations":[{"node_id":"<failed_node.id>","parent_id":"<parent_id>","failure_class":"<failed_node.label>"}]}
```

Write to `.cortex/.session/current-task.json`, then call `pipeline_handoff()`.
