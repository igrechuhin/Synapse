# No Test Skipping (MANDATORY)

**ENFORCEMENT**: Skips are tightly controlled; CI blocks violations.

## Rules

- **No blanket skips**: Do not skip entire modules/suites.
- **Justify every skip**: Use `pytest.skip`/`@pytest.mark.skip` only with a clear reason and linked ticket/issue.
- **Temporary only**: Include a removal/reenable condition; revisit before release.
- **No silent xfail**: `xfail` must specify condition and reason; avoid permanent xfails.
- **Environment guards**: If gating by platform/env, document the condition explicitly.

## Guidance

- Prefer fixing flaky/slow tests instead of skipping.
- If external dependency is unavailable, use mocks/fakes; skip only when unavoidable.
- Review skips regularly; remove once the blocking issue is resolved.
